# shinyapps.io disconnection test application

This application is from: https://community.rstudio.com/t/shiny-disconnects-after-two-clicks/140690

I've deployed it to: https://winston.shinyapps.io/disconnect/

It crashed when it had 1GB of memory, but after I increased it to 2GB, it ran without trouble.
